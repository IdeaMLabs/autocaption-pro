Extract this ZIP (full-agent-project.zip) into the root of the GitHub repository linked to Cloudflare Pages. Commit and push all files. In GitHub → Settings → Secrets and Variables → Actions, add: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (Claude API key), GH_TOKEN (GitHub token with contents:write access), and GH_REPO (format: owner/repo). Optionally add SITE_URL as a variable for the production URL. After pushing, Cloudflare will redeploy. Verify: /diag should return diag ok, and /paypal/notify should return paypal notify GET ok on GET, and { "error": "missing_fields" } on POST with empty JSON. The workflows in .github/workflows will continuously check and self-heal these endpoints automatically.
