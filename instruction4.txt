Extract this ZIP (full-agent-quickstart(1).zip) into the root of your GitHub repository linked to Cloudflare Pages. Commit and push all files to your main branch. In GitHub → Settings → Secrets and Variables → Actions, add: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (Claude API key), GH_TOKEN (GitHub token with contents:write access), and GH_REPO (format: owner/repo). Optionally add SITE_URL as a variable for the production URL. After pushing, Cloudflare will auto-deploy when it sees the /functions folder. Verify endpoints: /diag should return diag ok, /paypal/notify should return paypal notify GET ok on GET, and { "error": "missing_fields" } when POSTed with {}. The workflows in .github/workflows will then continuously monitor and self-heal endpoints automatically.
