FINAL END-TO-END ML TEST INSTRUCTIONS
====================================

1. Extract this ZIP into the repository root.
   - scripts/test-end-to-end-ml.js → goes into scripts/
   - .github/workflows/end-to-end-ml-test.yml → goes into .github/workflows/

2. Commit & push changes:
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add full end-to-end ML outreach automated test"
   git push origin main

3. What this does:
   - Runs automatically after every push to main branch.
   - Simulates a Stripe payment → webhook → status check.
   - Calls /process with a sample YouTube URL for transcription.
   - Confirms /status updates to "done" with transcript text.
   - Submits demo YouTuber data via /youtuber-data.
   - Runs /ai-processor to confirm outreach generation works.
   - Verifies /download endpoint responds with transcript.

4. Check results:
   - Go to GitHub → Actions tab → End-to-End ML Test workflow.
   - Logs will show each step (payment → process → AI/ML outreach → download).
   - If all pass, the system is fully production-ready for both transcription and AI/ML outreach.

This ensures the entire business + technical pipeline is tested automatically after each deployment.
