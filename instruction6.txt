Download and extract openai-guardrails-bundle.zip into the repository root. Replace the existing functions/process.js with the updated file, and add the new functions/reset.js. Confirm that the KV namespace AUTO_KV is still bound to KV_STORE. In Cloudflare Dashboard → Workers & Pages → Triggers, set up a Cron Trigger with schedule 0 0 * * * pointing to /reset. Commit and push changes to the repository. Run the included GitHub Action (guardrail-test.yml) manually to verify: (1) with spend set to 7.95, /process returns "queued", (2) with spend set to 10.00, /process returns "delayed". Confirm via /status and Cloudflare logs that jobs are properly queued and not lost. Once verified, redeploy to production.
